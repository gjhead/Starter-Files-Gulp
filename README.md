# Starter-Files-Gulp
My basic Gulp Starter Files.

These are my basic starter files for Gulp.  I usually make edits to these based on my project, but in general this is what I start with.

Based by task:

// LINT

This is a general javascript linter.  I'm sloppy with my js, so this helps me keep things in line a tiny bit.

// STYLES

This will compile my sass files, run autoprifixer and create a sourcemap

// HTML

I currently use the .kit extension.  I realize I can get a lot more power templating engine - and will look into it at some point - 
but generally, for a majority of my projects, all I really need is what the .kit engine gives me:

- Create / Pass along variables
- Create / Pass along includes

// COPY

This copies files over to my build directory.  Mainly images and anything in the "basedir" directory.

// LIVERELOAD

Livereload will update for all the tasks it needs to.  I use the LiveReload plugin for Chrome but there are other extensions you can use:

http://livereload.com/extensions/

// OTHER

Not much else going on here.  I'll update these files whenever necessary.
